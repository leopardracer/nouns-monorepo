# pnpm Workspace Standards

This repository uses **pnpm workspaces** for monorepo management. Follow these standards when working with packages and dependencies.

## Workspace Structure

The monorepo is organized as follows:
- Root workspace contains shared tooling and configuration
- All packages are located in `packages/*` directory
- Each package has its own `package.json` with specific dependencies

## Package Management Commands

### Installing Dependencies
- **Root dependencies**: `pnpm add <package> -w` (workspace root)
- **Package-specific**: `pnpm add <package> --filter <package-name>`
- **Dev dependencies**: `pnpm add -D <package> --filter <package-name>`

### Running Scripts
- **All packages**: `pnpm run <script>` (uses Turbo for orchestration)
- **Specific package**: `pnpm run <script> --filter <package-name>`
- **Multiple packages**: `pnpm run <script> --filter <pattern>`

### Common Patterns
```bash
# Install dependency in specific package
pnpm add react --filter nouns-webapp

# Run dev server for webapp only
pnpm run dev --filter nouns-webapp

# Build all packages
pnpm run build

# Run tests in all packages
pnpm run test
```

Remember: pnpm workspaces provide efficient dependency management and disk usage. Always use pnpm commands instead of npm or yarn in this repository.
